# Tags

> Various text interfaces within the Geometry Dash client can be manipulated using special tags similar to markup languages such as `HTML.` Geometry Dash has 4 primary types of tags

- Colour Tags
- Fade Tags
- Delay Tags
- Shake Tags

## Colour Tags

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wyliemaster/gddocs/master/assets/screenshots/colour_tags.png" class="padded alertlayer">

> Colour Tags are used to style areas of text with colour. They contain both a start and an end tag - the start tag defining which colour should be rendered on screen and the end tag denoting when to stop reading. 

**Usage:** `<cl>Coloured Text!</c>`

## Instant/Fade Tags

> Fade Tags are used to fade in a block of text on screen instead of making it appear character by character. Similarly to colour tags, Fade tags have a start and end tag to denote which piece of text should appear instantly. The number is specified in centiseconds, which is 1/100th of a second.

**Usage:** `<i100>Freaky</i>`

## Delay Tags

> Delay tags are used to create a delay before a specific string in dialog boxes. The game detects a Delay Tag if the string contains a `<d` and then it reads the next 3 characters and converts them into an integer. This value is then passed into the [CCDelayTime](https://docs.cocos2d-x.org/api-ref/cplusplus/V2.2/d6/dde/classcocos2d_1_1_c_c_delay_time.html) class from the [cocos2d-x](/) engine which Geometry Dash uses. The number is specified in centiseconds, which is 1/100th of a second.

**Usage:** `<d010>.<d010>.<d030>.`

## Shake Tags

> Shake Tags are used to render shaky text on screen. The number denotes the intensity of the shake.

**Usage:** `<s260>CHOPPER!</s>`


## Notes

- In 2.1, failing to add an end tag for Colour tags and Instant tags would result in the game crashing, but this was fixed in 2.2

- In 2.1, the Fade tags actually made the block of text appear instantly, and so no number was required. To emulate the old behavior, you can use `<i000>`

- Only Colour tags are usable without modifying the client - via level descriptions and comment bans

- The tags are defined within the `MultilineBitmapFont` class and are sometimes disabled within the create method using a bool
